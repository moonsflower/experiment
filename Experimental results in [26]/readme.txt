In this folder, the physical experimental results of the control strategy in [26] are provided. "Evolution of tracking trajectory.fig" shows the tracking trajectory of the WMR, while "Trajectory tracking error.fig" displays the tracking error. It can be observed that the control strategy in [26] successfully completes the WMR's trajectory tracking task. However, the tracking error in [26] is close to 0.27m, whereas the tracking error of our control strategy is only 0.16m. "Linear velocity control input and angular velocity control input.fig" illustrates the control signals in [26], where due to the utilization of traditional super-twisting sliding mode reaching law, there is no obvious chattering phenomenon in the control signals.
